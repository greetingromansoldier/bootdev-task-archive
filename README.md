# bootdev-tasks-archive
Archive of accomplished tasks on boot.dev platform

## Why?

From nearly the very beginning of using bootdev for my education, I've been archivizing task assignments and my solutions. 

Here's two main purposes to do that:

1. At the start, I didn't have money to pay for their content, but because they structure content in a way when you can see source files even without subscription (and check them by yourself), I just did coding on my own machine. So instead of just "check and delete" I started saving this content as a reference and archive. That also helped to track down my progress
2. Now I have subscription, but I prefer to do tasks in my own environment, not in browser, because it just way more.. Pleasurable and Convenient (I use neovim btw) in my case

## Why publish though?

Git, reliable cloud archive, etc etc, but the main point that **I just can**.

## Some Future Features

- [ ] Make AI-generated markdown descriptions for missing part of content
- [ ] Make everything properly named and ordered
- [ ] Check for.. *inappropriate language* and non-english words in some files
