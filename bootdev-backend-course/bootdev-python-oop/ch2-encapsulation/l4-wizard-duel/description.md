Complete the following methods to the Wizard class:

  1)  get_fireballed() should remove 500 health from the wizard.
  2)  drink_mana_potion() should add 100 mana to the wizard's reserves.

Both methods should operate on the instance of the class. They take no inputs and returns no values explicitly.
