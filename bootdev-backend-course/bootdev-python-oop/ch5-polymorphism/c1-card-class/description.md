We'll take a break from Age of Dragons to work on a simple deck of cards.

## Assignment

Complete the `Card` class:

1.  [ ] Define a constructor that takes `rank` and `suit` as parameters and sets `rank`, `suit`, `rank_index`, and `suit_index` instance variables.
    *   You will need the indexes of the `ranks`, and `suits` to help you compare them against each other. Keep in mind that a `rank` and a `suit` are just strings within a list.
2.  [ ] Overload the following comparison operators:
    *   `==`: `__eq__`
    *   `>`: `__gt__`
    *   `<`: `__lt__`

## Ranking the Cards

A card is "greater than" another card if it has a higher rank. However, if the ranks are the same, the card with the higher suit is "greater than" the other card. This same logic applies to the "less than" operator. The "equal to" operator should check that the rank AND suit are equal.

The suits and ranks are defined as global variables. *The lower the index, the lower the rank or suit.*

## Tips

The `.index` list method is very useful when trying to determine the index of an element in a list.
