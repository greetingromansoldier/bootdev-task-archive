# Rectangle Class

We're going to build hit-box logic for our game step by step, starting with a simple **Rectangle**.

## Assignment

Complete the `__init__()` method. Configure the class to have properties matching the variables passed into the constructor in **this order**:

1. `x1`
2. `y1`
3. `x2`
4. `y2`

That is, the constructor should accept four parameters—`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`—and store them as properties of the instance.
