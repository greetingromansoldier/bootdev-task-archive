# Human Movement

A `Human` class and its constructor have already been created for you. We don't want other game developers using our `Human` class to worry about how humans move. We'll abstract that away by encapsulating the private `__pos_x`, `__pos_y`, and `__speed` variables.

## Assignment

Complete the following methods:

1. **`move_right()`**  
   - Adds the human's speed to its x-position.

2. **`move_left()`**  
   - Subtracts the human's speed from its x-position.

3. **`move_up()`**  
   - Adds the human's speed to its y-position.

4. **`move_down()`**  
   - Subtracts the human's speed from its y-position.

5. **`get_position()`**  
   - Returns the x-position and y-position as a tuple.
