# Archer Class

In **Age of Dragons**, all archers are humans, but not all humans are archers. All humans have a `name`, while archers have an additional `__num_arrows` property.

## Assignment

Complete the `Archer` class. It should inherit from the `Human` class.

1. In its constructor (`__init__` method):
   - Call its parentâ€™s constructor to set the `name` (and any other needed properties).
   - Set its unique `__num_arrows` property.
