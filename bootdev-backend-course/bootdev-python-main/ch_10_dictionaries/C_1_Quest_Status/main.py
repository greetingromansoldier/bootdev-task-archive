# Quest Status:

# Fantasy Quest needs a way to check the status of an individual character's quest status. 
# The game stores each character's progress in a nested data structure, and your job is to fetch the status of a particular quest.

# Here's the structure of a progress dictionary:

# {
#     "entity": {
#         "character": {
#             "name": "Kaladin",
#             "quests": {
#                 "bridge_run": {
#                     "status": "In Progress",
#                 },
#                 "talk_to_syl": {
#                     "status": "Completed",
#                 },
#             },
#         }
#     }
# }

# Complete the get_quest_status function. 
# It accepts a progress dictionary and returns the character's status in the "bridge_run" quest. 
# Chain the keys to access the nested data.

# actual code:

def get_quest_status(progress):
    return progress["entity"]["character"]["quests"]["bridge_run"]["status"]
