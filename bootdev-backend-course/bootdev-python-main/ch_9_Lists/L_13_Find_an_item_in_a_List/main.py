# We need to check if a player has a specific item in their inventory. 
# In the contains_leather_scraps function, use the no-index syntax to iterate over each item in items. 
# If you find an item called Leather Scraps, set the found variable to True.

# actual code:

def contains_leather_scraps(items):
    found = False

    # don't touch above this line

    for item in items:
        if item == "Leather Scraps":
            found = True
            

    # don't touch below this line

    return found
