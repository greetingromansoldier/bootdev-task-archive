# code before changes:

# empty

# assignment:

# Write the check_mount_rental function. It takes two inputs:

# 1. time_used - the amount of time the mount has been used in minutes
# 2. time_purchased - the amount of time the character rented the mount for
#  -If time_used meets or exceeds time_purchased, 
#  -then the rental is expired and greedy Uper will charge a fee, 
#     so the function should return the string "overtime charged"


# Otherwise, return the string "no charges yet"

# Bonus: (accomplished)
# Try to accomplish this without an "else" statement.

# actual code:

def check_mount_rental (time_used, time_purchased):
    if time_used >= time_purchased:
        return 'overtime charged'
    return 'no charges yet'
