# code before changes: 

# def combat_evaluation(player_power, enemy_defense):
#     advantage, disadvantage, evenly_matched = False, False, False

#     # your code here

#     return advantage, disadvantage, evenly_matched

# Combat Advantage:

# Fantasy Quest doesn't have any way for players to know if they are strong enough to fight certain enemies.

# If a player's power level is greater than the enemy's defense, that player has an advantage
# If the player's power and enemy's defense are equal, they are evenly matched
# Otherwise, that player has a disadvantage.

# assignment:

# On line 4 write an if/elif/else block. 
# Using the rules specified above, set:
#  advantage, disadvantage, or evenly_matched to True 
# depending on the values of player_power and enemy_defense.

# For example, if the player's power is greater than the enemy's defense, 
# advantage should be set to True. etc.

# actual code:

def combat_evaluation(player_power, enemy_defense):
    advantage, disadvantage, evenly_matched = False, False, False

    if player_power > enemy_defense:
        advantage = True
    elif player_power == enemy_defense:
        evenly_matched = True
    else:
        disadvantage = True

    return advantage, disadvantage, evenly_matched
