# code before changes:

# def process_transactions(purchase_orders):
#     # ?

# assignment:

# Complete the process_transactions function. 

# It takes a list of purchase orders. Each order is a dictionary. Look through the main() function to see the shape of this data.

#     First, create an empty list of leftovers.
#     Then, loop over the list of purchase orders.
#     For each order, try to process the order with the purchase_item function. If an exception is raised, print the raised exception.
#     If there is not an error, then the purchase was successful. Append the remaining money to the leftovers list. If there is an error, don't add anything to the leftovers.
#     Be sure to loop over the entire list of purchase orders.
#     Finally, after the loop has ended, return the leftovers list.

# Keep the same order of purchases, but with the unsuccessful purchases removed.

# actual code:

def process_transactions(purchase_orders):
    leftovers = []
    for order in purchase_orders:
        try:
            purchase_item_func = purchase_item(order["price"], order["gold_available"])

            print("exception happened")
            print(e)
        leftovers.append(purchase_item_func)
