# Toggle Case

We need to add a feature to Doc2Doc that switches the capitalization of all the words in a line.

## Assignment

Complete the `toggle_case` function using `string methods`. It takes a string as input `line`, and returns a string.

1. If `line` is in `titlecase`, convert it to all uppercase and add three "!" to the end.
2. If `line` is all uppercase, convert it to all lowercase except for the first letter and remove all trailing "!".
3. If `line` is all lowercase or only the first letter is capitalized, convert it to title case.
4. Otherwise, just return `line` unchanged.

## Tips

*   You will have to use the link to the official Python documentation to find the right string methods. Reading documentation is a skill all developers need to master.
