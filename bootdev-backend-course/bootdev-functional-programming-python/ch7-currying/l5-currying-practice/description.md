# Currying Practice

Markdown makes [displaying images](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1) as simple as possible. To add an image to a markdown document, just use this syntax:

```markdown
![alt text](url "title")
```

*   `alt text` a brief description for screen readers and web scrapers. Required for accessibility.
*   `url` url or relative path to image.
*   `title` shown on mouse hover. Optional.

# Assignment

Doc2Doc makes using markdown a breeze. This includes adding images to markdown documents.

Complete the `create_markdown_image` function using currying. It takes a string input, `alt_text`.

1.  [ ] Enclose the `alt_text` in square brackets prefixed with an exclamation point `![alt_text]`.
2.  [ ] Define an inner function that also takes a string input, `url`:
    1.  [ ] The inner function should first escape any parentheses in the URL by replacing them with [encoded sequences](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP).
        1.  [ ] Use the `.replace()` string method to change any opening parenthesis `(` into `%28`.
        2.  [ ] Do the same to change any closing parenthesis `)` into `%29`.
    2.  [ ] Enclose the `url` with parentheses `(url)`.
    3.  [ ] Add the enclosed `url` to the end of the enclosed `alt_text`: `![alt_text](url)`
    4.  [ ] Define the innermost function. It should take an optional string input for the `title`.
        1.  [ ] If a `title` is passed:
            1.  [ ] Enclose it in double quotes.
            2.  [ ] Then add the quoted `title` to the image syntax by first removing the closing parenthesis `)` from the end of the image syntax.
            3.  [ ] Add a space and the quoted `title` with a closing parenthesis `)` to the end of the image syntax: `![alt_text](url "title")`
        2.  [ ] Return the finished image syntax.
    5.  [ ] Return the innermost function
3.  [ ] Return the inner function
