Counting the words in a document can be slow, so we want to *memoize* it.

Complete the `word_count_memo` function. It takes two inputs:

1.  A `document` string.
2.  A `memos` dictionary. The keys are full document strings, and the values are the word count of the document.

It should return two values:

1.  The word count of the given document
2.  An updated `memos` dictionary.

Here are the steps to follow:

1.  Create a `.copy()` of the `memos` dictionary.
2.  If the document is `in` the `memos` dictionary, just `return` the associated word count and the `memos` copy. No need to recompute the word count.
3.  Otherwise, use the provided `word_count` function to count the words in the given `document`.
4.  Store the word count in the `memos` copy.
5.  `return` the word count and the updated `memos` copy.
